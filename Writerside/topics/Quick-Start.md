Besides stable releases of the plugin, we also release the EAP version, which builds every time there's 
a code merged into the master branch.

To use those EAPs, you need to enable EAP repos in your plugins settings: 

1. Open **Settings | Plugins**, click on gear icon on the right. 

2. Select **Manage Plugin Repositories...** from the dropdown. 

3. Click "+", enter `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list` and click OK. 

4. Restart your IDE, go to the **Settings | Plugins** once again and update your Move Language plugin.
