# FAQ

## Which IDEs are compatible? 

Intellij-Move is compatible with all Intellij-based IDEs (version 2023.2 or later). 
We usually support the latest three generations of the IDE, and drop versions at the same time 
as Android Studio releases a new stable version.

## Does the plugin uses Aptos Move Analyzer or Move compiler? 

The plugin's language analysis is implemented from scratch, leveraging the [Intellij Platform](https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/idea/) infrastructure 
for incremental analysis and indexing. 

## Any tips for migrating from Emacs, Vim or VS Code?

For the Emacs / Vim tips, see notes at the [Intellij Rust plugin FAQ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182--deprecated-rust/docs/rust-faq.html#migration). 

For VS Code, [RustRover migration docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/how-to-move-to-rustrover-from-vs-code.html) could be handy.
